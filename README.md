It features live result updates and a group chat, all powered by a high-performance Go backend designed for speed and scalability.‚ú® FeaturesPrivate Game Rooms: Create a room and invite friends with a unique, shareable code.Real-time Voting: Cast your vote and see the results update live for everyone in the room.Live Group Chat: Chat with your friends in the game room while you play.AI-Generated Questions: Fresh, interesting questions are delivered to your room daily.Question History: View the results of questions from the past 7 days.Secure Authentication: Email and password-based user accounts.üöÄ Tech StackThis project uses a modern, decoupled architecture to ensure high performance and scalability.Frontend: SvelteKit & Tailwind CSS (Deployed on Vercel)Backend: Go (Echo Framework) & WebSockets (Deployed on Google Cloud Platform)Database: PostgreSQL (Cloud SQL)Cache: Redis (Cloud Memorystore) for real-time updates & caching.üèóÔ∏è Backend ArchitectureThe backend is built using a Layered Architecture to ensure a clear separation of concerns, making the application highly testable and maintainable.handler: Manages incoming HTTP and WebSocket requests. Contains no business logic.service: The core of the application, containing all business logic.repository: The only layer that communicates with the database and cache.domain: Contains the core data structures used throughout the application.üõ†Ô∏è Local Development SetupTo run the backend server locally, please ensure you have Go 1.22+ and Docker installed.Clone the repository:git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd likely-game-project/backend
Set up Environment Variables:Copy the example .env file:cp .env.example .env
Edit the new .env file with your local configuration. See the table below for details.Start Local Database & Cache:A docker-compose.yml file is included for convenience. Start local PostgreSQL and Redis containers:docker-compose up -d
Run Database Migrations:(We will add a migration tool like golang-migrate here later)Install Dependencies & Run:go mod tidy
go run ./cmd/server/main.go
